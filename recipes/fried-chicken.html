  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Here's a simple and tasty fried chicken recipe for you:
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken (cut into pieces) or 8 chicken pieces (legs, thighs, wings)</li>
    <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for spice)</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and pour over the buttermilk. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours, or overnight for best results.
    </li>
    <li>
In a separate bowl, mix the flour with salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper if you want a bit of spice.
    </li>
    <li>
Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, letting any excess drip off. Dredge each piece in the seasoned flour, pressing lightly so it sticks.
    </li>
    <li>
Carefully add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, avoiding overcrowding. Fry for about 12 to 15 minutes per side until golden brown and fully cooked (internal temperature should reach 165°F / 74°C).
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the chicken and place it on paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve hot with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or biscuits.
    </li>
  </ol>
